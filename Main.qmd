Congratulations on being accepted into a CyberDragons team! This pledge is a promise that you will use your skills for good and not evil. Please read the pledge carefully and sign below.

## Competitor Code of Conduct
1) I will consider the ethical and legal implications of my online actions when using my cyber defense skills.
2) I will not conduct, nor will I condone, any actions that attack, penetrate, or interfere with another individualâ€™s computer system illegally. 
3) I will not illegally copy or distribute software or other intellectual property.
4) I will not participate in cyberbullying, which includes behaviors as online teasing, threatening, intimidating, humiliating, sexual/racial harassment, and stalking.
5) I will follow the rules of every cybersecurity competition I participate in and seek guidance from Ms. Rachkovskiy for any disputes over integrity or competition rules. For CyberPatriot specifically, I agree to abide by the rules in the CyberPatriot Rules Book and report all rule violations to Ms. Rachkovskiy.
6) I will not tamper with, modify, or reverse engineer any element of the competitions I will participate in.
7) I will not attempt to deceive or socially engineer other competitors by sending erroneous/deceptive information on social networking sites.
9) I will not share information about any competition's tasks, questions, or answers on any website, forum, or social media platform.

By signing below, I understand that violation of this code of conduct is grounds for **immediate dismissal** from my team and disqualification of my team from the competition of contention. I also understand that I will be banned from participating in future competitions. I will strive to use my participation in CyberPatriot and other competitions to further my understanding of cybersecurity, and not to harm others or break the law.
